# Keyword-Encoder
A keyword encoder developed as part of a Computing Science course taken at Saint Mary's University.
The encoder takes the most common words found in a text corpus and uses Huffman coding to assign each word with a unique number of bits.
Once a bit code has been assigned to each word it can be used to search for occurences of the encoded word in the original text corpus.
